# **BedWars Center – Developer Hub**

Welcome to the developer side of **BedWars Center**.
This space is for the people who help build, improve, and shape the technical foundation of the project.

## **About the Project**

BedWars Center started in 2024 with a simple idea:
**build a fair, secure, and community-shaped BedWars experience.**

This repository exists to organize our developer resources, documentation, and internal standards.
If you want to learn more about the project itself, you can always check our website for the full story.

## **How We Work**

We keep development as open and straightforward as possible.
You’ll find things like:

* General systems
* Public APIs
* Documentation
* Coding guidelines
* Shared libraries

These parts are available for contributors who want to understand or extend the project.

Some areas, however, stay private for security reasons, including:

* Anti-cheat internals
* Packet verification logic
* Security checks and detection models
* Infrastructure configurations
* Protection and performance systems

These are kept closed to protect server integrity and prevent misuse.

## **Security**

Security is one of our top priorities.
We use server-side validation, behavior analysis, and internal monitoring systems to keep the environment safe.
These components are maintained privately and updated regularly.

## **Contributing**

If you’d like to get involved, you’re welcome to:

* Report issues
* Suggest improvements
* Submit pull requests
* Help with documentation

We build this project together — community feedback and contributions matter.
