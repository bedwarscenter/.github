## 🤝 **A Development Community Built on Collaboration**

Our development culture is shaped around openness, communication, and teamwork.

### ✔️ What We Share Openly

We openly provide:

* Reusable libraries
* Public APIs and integration examples
* Non-sensitive server logic
* Developer documentation
* Contribution and coding standards
* Community-informed roadmaps

We aim to help every contributor feel informed and empowered.

### ❌ What Stays Private

To protect the server and ensure fair gameplay, some components are intentionally **not** open-source:

* Anti-cheat internals
* Packet validation & detection logic
* Security heuristics and triggers
* Infrastructure configurations
* DDoS, exploit & performance protection systems

These systems remain private to maintain server integrity and prevent abuse.

## 🔒 **Security Principles**

Security is one of our highest priorities.

We use a layered security approach involving:

* Behavioral analysis
* Server-side validation
* Private monitoring systems
* Internal review pipelines
* Fast-response patching

These components are kept internal but constantly improved to ensure a safe environment for everyone.
